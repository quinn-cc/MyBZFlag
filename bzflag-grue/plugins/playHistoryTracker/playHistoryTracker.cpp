/*
 * Grue's Play History Tracker
 * - Keeps track of rampages, killing sprees, etc. This version is based off the
 *	 built-in version that comes with BZFlag.
 * - Awards bounty points for stopping rampages by opponents, penalizes
 * 	 teammates that end rampages.
 * - This works with the avengerFlag, dimensionDoorFlag, and annihilationFlag
 * 	 plugin, however those plugins are not necessary to run this one.
