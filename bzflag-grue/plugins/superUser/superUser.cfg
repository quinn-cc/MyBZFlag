  # If you want to grant a specific user extra permissions, you should put
  # a line similar to the ones below on this configuration file. The number
  # before the = represents the BZID of the user, which can be easily found
  # by looking at the URL of his forum profile. For example, Tim Riker's
  # profile is at forums.bzflag.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=1037,
  # which means that his BZID is 1037. Permissions should be inserted after
  # the = and be seperated by commas.
