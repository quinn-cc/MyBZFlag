/*
 * This plugin oversees a large part of Scarwall's CTF mechanics. Only works
 * for Red and Green teams.
 * 
 * - No team caputres: By setting _noTeamCapture to 1 in the bzw file, teammates
 *   will no longer be able to capture their own team flag.
 * 
 * - Capture reward points: Points are awarded to players capping the opposing
 *   team's flag. The number of points awarded is calculated by a formula that
 *   increases when the team inbalance is greater. The idea is that when it is
 *   harder to cap, more points are awarded. The formula for calculating the
 *   points if team A caps team B 
 * 		= (_baseCapMult)*B + (B - A)(_unbalancedCapMult)
 *   where _unbalancedCapMult is a server variable. However, note that points
 *   are only awarded to players if the cap is fair (see unfair capture penalty)
 * 		
 * - Unfair capture penalty: Points are only awarded to players if the cap was
 *   fair. If the teams are too inbalanced, and the player capping is on the
 *   team with more players, then that player will recieve a point penalty for
 *   capping unfairly. Team A capping team B is fair if
 * 		A / B < _fairCap
 *   where _fairCap is a server variable. If team A capping team B is unfair,
 *   player A will recieve a point penalty calculated by
 * 		(_unfairCapMult)(A - B)
 * 
 * - Switch teams on unfair cap: If the server variable _switchTeamsOnUnfairCap
 *   is turned on, then the capper will be switched to the other team if they
 *   capture unfairly.  
 * 
 * - Own team capture penalty: Players that capture their own team flag are
 *   recieve a point penalty. If team A captures their own team flag, the
 *   penalty amount is calculated by
 * 		(_selfCapMult)*A
 * 
 * - Wait time between caps: Prevents players from capping a team over and over.
 *   If team A caps team B, team A must wait _capWaitTime before they can grab
 *   team B's flag.
 * 
 * - F12ing before the cap: Players who f12 or quit rapidly within
 *   _cachedMemoryTime of the cap will be called out by the server. Furthermore,
 *   cappers will not be penalized if the f12'ers quit to make the teams
 *   unbalanced. If these f12'ers join back into the game within
 *   _quitterMemoryTime seconds, the server will call them out again. The
 *   server recongnizes the players by ipAddress, not callsign. If a player
 *   attempts to join back under a different callsign, the server will
 *   recognize that and call them out further.
